**PEER GROUP ANALYSIS TASK:** {{ sector }} Sector Comprehensive Analysis
**Date:** {{ analysis_date }}
**Analysis Universe:** {{ symbols | length }} companies across {{ sector }} sector

**PEER GROUP UNIVERSE:**
{% for symbol in symbols %}
**{{ symbol }}** (Current Price: ${{ prices[symbol] if prices and symbol in prices else 'N/A' }})
{% endfor %}

**COMPREHENSIVE FUNDAMENTAL DATA:**
{% for symbol in symbols %}
=== {{ symbol }} FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS ===
{{ fundamental_data[symbol] | truncate(2000) if fundamental_data and symbol in fundamental_data else 'Data pending analysis' }}

{% endfor %}

**COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL DATA:**

**CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no text outside JSON.**

**NUMERIC PRECISION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Scores/rankings: Use 1 decimal (e.g., 8.5)
- Prices: Use 2 decimals (e.g., 247.45)
- Ratios (P/E, P/B, etc.): Use 2 decimals (e.g., 28.53)
- Percentages: Use 2 decimals as decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%)
This reduces token usage while maintaining comparative precision.
