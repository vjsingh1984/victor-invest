**NUMERIC PRECISION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Financial values: Use 2 decimal places (e.g., revenue: 1500.25 not 1500.2534823)
- Ratios: Use 2 decimals (e.g., P/E: 28.53, current_ratio: 1.85)
- Percentages/Growth: Use 2 decimals as decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15% growth)
- Margins: Use 4 decimals as decimal (e.g., 0.2534 for 25.34% margin)
- Scores/ratings: Use 1 decimal (e.g., 8.5, not 8.534823)
- EPS: Use 2 decimals (e.g., 1.45 not 1.4499969)
This reduces token usage and improves readability while maintaining analytical precision.

   - All financial ratios from calculated_metrics
   - Gross margin, operating margin, net margin from calculated_metrics

1. Quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons

3. Margin trends and profitability drivers
4. Cash flow generation and quality of earnings
5. Balance sheet changes and capital efficiency
6. Any one-time items or unusual charges
7. Management commentary and forward guidance
8. **EXTRACT and INCLUDE all calculated metrics and ratios provided in the data**
9. **CALCULATE and INCLUDE TTM metrics using the 8 quarters of data provided**

Be specific, quantitative, and highlight both achievements and concerns for this specific quarter. ALWAYS include EPS, shares outstanding, and TTM metrics if the data is available.
